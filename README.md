### Hi there 👋


🔭 I’m currently working on building my own portfolio. My journey has just begun and I have a long way to go. 
  I am a javascript developer and am comfortable in working on vue.js and react.js. 
  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to build and maintain a backend architecture. I am using nodejs + express for that.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me grow as a fullstack-developer. I am eager to know the "HOW" and the "WHY" of web.

📫 How to reach me: email me at pankajboruah28@gmail.com. I check my mails quite often💁.

⚡ Fun fact: I like to notice stuff. 

            One of the things that I have noticed recently: The way you look at yourself in the mirror(i.e. your mirror image) is not the image other people see. 
            This is true if you don't have a symmetric face like myself😃.
